Rough design goals.  Liable to change at any time:

* Really big map, like, world-sized.  Maybe.

* You can work for the devil

* Mapgen: mostly corridors, not very many rooms.  Find a way to make this not grindy.
 - NOTE: all of the NUMBERS following will almost certainly be changed when I find out what kind of map they generate, but they should give a general idea of what sort of dungeon is being made.
 - generate rooms rnz(30) apart in each direction.
 - their size is rnz(10) multiplied by 2 half the time, divided by 2 the other half
 - corridors are between 1 and 3 cells thick, and switch every rn2(20) cells
 - corridors go for rnz(11) cells before either stopping at a room or going again in a random direction
